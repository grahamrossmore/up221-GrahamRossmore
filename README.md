Profile: 
I'm a second year MURP, in the TPP Focus. Born in Vancouver, lived in Los Angeles for the past 14 years. My interests are primarily concentreated on land use and transportation, including rail, bus, and parking policies and planning. I enjoy the various levels of government and how involved agency cooperation is with respect to planning.

Description of Course:
As a future Transportation Planner, it is crucial that I learn how to use GIS and create maps using GIS datasets. Admittedly, the user interface of GitHub and Juypter make me a little nervous as it seems very unpolished and technicial, which is not my vibe.

Project Ideas:
I need to give this some additional thought; however, I envision mapping out all of the outdoor dining Al Fresco locoations that are occupying on-street parking meters to get a better understanding of the distribution of benefits from this program. I am also interested in mapping areas to determine parking needs, demand and access.

Objectives for Class:
My objective in this class is to do my best to understand the concepts and how to create maps. My expectations are that it may be challenging and take longer for me to learn but I am confident I will succeed in this course.
